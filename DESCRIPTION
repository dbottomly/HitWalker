Description: HitWalker provides the framework for prioritizing sample variants detected using an exome capture (or other method) relative to functional assay results based on protein-protein interaction data. In addition to prioritization, it also provides a simple visualization facility.  It uses the R/DBI package and therefore requires a supported datasource as well as appropriate queries.
